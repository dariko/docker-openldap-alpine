# openldap-alpine

This repository is used to build a minimal openldap container.

A minimal initialization script is given as `/init_config.sh`. +
This script configures `cn=config` as `olcRootDn` for the `cn=config` db. +
An environment variable `OPENLDAP_ALPINE_CNCONFIG_PW` is *needed* and is used
as olcRootPW for the `cn=config` entry.

The `run.sh` script, set as `CMD` for the container, accepts two variables:

- `OPENLDAP_ALPINE_LISTEN_URI`( `"ldap:// ldaps://"` )
+
given to `slapd` as `-h` parameter.

- `OPENLDAP_ALPINE_LOGLEVEL`( `"256"` )
+
given to `slapd` as `-d` parameter.
